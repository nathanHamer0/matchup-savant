COMPULSARIES

- Scale normalized score to something like an interpreted percentile
  - Currently have a pre-comparison normalization for pitcher and batter yields on seperate normality scales [DONE]
    - Combining seperate normality scales yields weight-based distortions in final data
  - Must generate a set of matchup scores and post-normalize from that singular normality scale based on the derived means and standard-deviations [TODO]
  - Negative unit-test cases [TODO]

ELECTIVES

- Incorporate handedness splits for increased accuracy [TODO]
- Write monotonicity checks for validation [TODO]
- Integrate assertions into functions to raise and handle errors [TODO]
